Whenever you go to pay for something online,Buy apple ipad from china, look for a little lock logo that will show up in the address bar at the head of the URL. This means that the page that you are looking at is under encryption, which means that it is a page that only authorized people are going to have access too.\nBefore you pick up your keys and head to the mall, it's time for you to sit down and consider another alternative. More and more people are bragging about the great deals that they have gotten from shopping online, and though you may be tempted, the question of safety might be holding you back. There are lots of people out there who are very concerned about how safe shopping online really is, but the truth of the matter is that times have changed, and shopping online is as safe as heading to the local shopping center.\nIn addition to this, you'll discover that you have lots of advantages from shopping online. When you shop in person, you are limited to the stores that you can actually get to, and even then, you are going to be limited by what they have in stock.

While this may very well be a limitation of shopping online, the Internet vendors have gone a long way to make up for it.

      "text": "CHANDIGARH: People from all walks of life and prominent persons on Saturday poured in at the Rock Garden here to pay their last respects to Nek Chand, the man behind the iconic creation who breathed his last here on Friday.\nThe mortal remains of Chand were kept at the Rock Garden on Saturday for the public to pay their last respects. His funeral procession will pass through the city later today and the cremation will be held in the evening, his family members said.\nAmong the prominent persons who visited Rock Garden were Punjab Governor and Chandigarh Administrator, Kaptan Singh Solanki.\nChand had been ailing for the past few days and was admitted to a private hospital here. He was later shifted to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), where he passed away in the early hours yesterday. He was 90.\nChand is survived by his wife Kamla, son Anuj and daughter Neelam.\nEarlier on Saturday, his body was taken to the Rock Garden from his house at Sector 27 here on the same route along which Chand used to regularly cycle to the garden.\nEntry to the Rock Garden was made free for the public for two days since Friday.\nThe administration of the Union Territory of Chandigarh has made necessary arrangements to bid the artistic genius a farewell with full state honours.\nThe news of his death came as a big shock to the numerous employees who had worked with him at the Rock Garden.\nSaid 57-year-old Payni Muthu, who started working with Chand from the age of 18, \"Baauji's (Chand's) demise came as a big shock. He was a kind-hearted man who inspired his employees to give their children the best education and teach them good values.\"\nAnother employee, Kaliamma, said that Chand used to be particular about every detail pertaining to his work.\n\"He would give us detailed instructions. Sometimes, he would also teach our children and play with them. His death has left a big void,\" she said.\nA roads inspector with the Public Works Department in Punjab, Chand had quietly built his magical kingdom using waste items like broken crockery, electrical fittings, glass bangles, bathroom tiles, wash basins, etc.\nThe iconic Rock Garden, inaugurated in 1976, is now spread over an area of nearly 40 acres. More than 2.5 lakh people from India and abroad visit it every year. The annual revenue generated from ticket sales at Rock Garden is around Rs 1.8 crore.\nChand's unique art has also been showcased in museums abroad.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Rock Garden,Punjab Governor and Chandigarh Administrator,Nek Chand Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.",
